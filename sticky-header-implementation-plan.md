# Sticky "Follow Us" Header Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Create a sticky social media follow header that appears on article pages, positioned below the main Prajavani header. This header contains social media buttons, date display, and user actions to improve reader engagement and social sharing during article reading.

## Feature Description
- **Location**: Between main site header and article content on story pages
- **Behavior**: Remains fixed/sticky while user reads article content
- **Purpose**: Keep social media engagement options always accessible during reading
- **Target Pages**: Article/story pages across the site

## Visual Reference
Based on Prajavani.net implementation - a sticky header containing:
- Current date display (left side)
- Site logo (center)
- "Follow Us" social media icons (WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram)
- Sign in button (right side)

## Implementation Phases

### **Phase 2: Social Media Integration (1-2 days)**
**Priority: HIGH** - Core engagement feature
- Add all 6 social platform buttons (WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram)

- Configure actual social media URLs

### **Phase 3: Mobile Experience Optimization (1-2 days)**
**Priority: HIGH** - Mobile reading experience

### **Phase 4: Polish & Testing (1-2 days)**

## Timeline Estimate
